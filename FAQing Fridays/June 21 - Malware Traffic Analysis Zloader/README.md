# June 21 - FAQing Friday - Malware Traffic Analysis with Zloader

## Environment

```
LAN segment range: 10.06.12.0/24 (10.06.12.0 through 10.06.12.255) 
Domain: frank-n-ted.com 
Domain controller: 10.06.12.12 - Frank-n-Ted-DC 
LAN segment gateway: 10.06.12.1 
LAN segment broadcast address: 10.06.12.255 
```

## Objective
What happened here? who downloaded what?

This is a little different than a lab with steps on what to do and different than an alert or observable provided for you.

Here we need to drill down what happened. Similarly to inspecting a capture of sniffed network traffic to debug or troubleshoot.
